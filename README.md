# SQL_Functions
This repository is directed to share some solutions to popular (or not) problems that we can find at the time to develop Queries in SQL. Principally, I use SQL Server of Microsoft, but the ideas behind the codes is the most important thing.

These are the functions that you can find in this repository:

1. **Capitalize Letter Function** [fnCapitalizeLettersV1](https://github.com/rich-coding/SQL_Functions/blob/main/fnCapitalizeLettersV1.sql): Convert the first letter of each word in Upper Case and the rest of the word in Lower Case. (Create date: oct-03-2023)
